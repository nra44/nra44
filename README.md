## A dataset I find interesting: [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/)
One of the datasets in the list which caught my eye was "OpenDataPhilly", which is a catalog of data projects related to Philadelphia or the Philadelphia area. I was drawn to this dataset in particular because I live in Philly, and browsing the list of data repositories which are collected in the dataset, they cover a wide variety of topics and uses which are valuable to someone who lives in the city, or is generally interested in the city's history or demographics. The dataset is available to the public, and it is easy to navigate the list and find repositories related to specific topics using subject headings.
