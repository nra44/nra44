## Hello!
My name is Nathan (he/him).
I am currently a graduate student at Drexel University in the LIS program.
In addition to my regular work, I volunteer at an archives and am a research assistant on the side.
I also like movies.

## A dataset I find interesting: [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/)
One of the datasets in the list which caught my eye was "OpenDataPhilly", which is a catalog of data projects related to Philadelphia or the Philadelphia area. I was drawn to this dataset in particular because I live in Philly, and browsing the list of data repositories which are collected in the dataset, they cover a wide variety of topics and uses which are valuable to someone who lives in the city, or is generally interested in the city's history or demographics. The dataset is available to the public, and it is easy to navigate the list and find repositories related to specific topics using subject headings.

## Topic/repository
I decided to look at the [digital-preservation](https://github.com/topics/digital-preservation) topic and the [internet-archive](https://github.com/topics/internet-archive) topic. In the digital-preservation topic I looked at the repository for [archivematica](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica). In the internet-archive topic I looked at the [plugin.program.iagl](https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iagl) repository, which is the launcher used on the Internet Archive to launch in-browser games contained in the archive. Both repositories had ample documentation, and their readme pages were helpful to navigating the repositories (the plugin.program.iagl readme even had images!).
